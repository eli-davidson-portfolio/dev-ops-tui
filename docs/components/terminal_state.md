# Terminal State Management

The terminal state management system provides robust handling of terminal states and cleanup.

## State Stack Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Initial: init_terminal_state
    Initial --> Saved: push_terminal_state
    Saved --> Restored: pop_terminal_state
    Restored --> Saved: push_terminal_state
    Saved --> Cleanup: cleanup_terminal_state
    Restored --> Cleanup: cleanup_terminal_state
    Cleanup --> [*]
```

## Operation Flow

```mermaid

    participant App
    participant TSM as Terminal State Manager
    participant Term as Terminal
    
    App->>TSM: init_terminal_state()
    TSM->>Term: Save Initial State
    TSM->>Term: Configure Terminal
    
    loop For Each Operation
        App->>TSM: push_terminal_state()
        TSM->>Term: Save Current State
        TSM->>Term: Configure New State
        Note over App,Term: Operation Executes
        App->>TSM: pop_terminal_state()
        TSM->>Term: Restore Previous State
    end
    
    App->>TSM: cleanup_terminal_state()
    TSM->>Term: Restore All States
    TSM->>Term: Final Cleanup
```

## State Stack Management

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Stack ["State Stack"]
        S1[State 1]
        S2[State 2]
        S3[State 3]
    end
    
    subgraph Operations ["Stack Operations"]
        PUSH[Push State]
        POP[Pop State]
        CLEAN[Cleanup]
    end
    
    PUSH --> S3
    POP --> S2
    CLEAN --> S1
```

## Key Features

- Maintains a stack of terminal states
- Ensures proper state restoration
- Handles cleanup on errors
- Manages terminal attributes
- Provides safe state transitions

## Usage Example

```bash
# Initialize terminal state
init_terminal_state

# Save current state for operation
push_terminal_state "operation_name"

# Execute operation with clean state
do_operation

# Restore previous state
pop_terminal_state "operation_name"

# Final cleanup
cleanup_terminal_state
```

## Error Handling

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Error ["Error Handling"]
        E1[Operation Error]
        E2[State Error]
        E3[Terminal Error]
    end
    
    subgraph Recovery ["Recovery Actions"]
        R1[Log Error]
        R2[Restore State]
        R3[Reset Terminal]
    end
    
    E1 --> R1
    E2 --> R2
    E3 --> R3
    
    R1 --> R2
    R2 --> R3
```

## Best Practices

1. Always pair push/pop operations
2. Use with_terminal_state for automatic cleanup
3. Handle errors at each state transition
4. Verify state restoration success
5. Clean up resources on exit
