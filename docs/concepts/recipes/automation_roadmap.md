# Repository Automation Roadmap

## Context

This roadmap is part of the larger DevOps TUI system, which focuses on getting developers into flow state quickly. Repository automation is one key component that reduces friction in the development process by automating repetitive tasks and enforcing best practices.

For the complete system overview, see:
- [Architecture Guide](../architecture_guide.md)
- [Practical Guide](../practical_guide.md)

## Current Status

We have implemented:
1. Basic repository management system in `tui/components/repo_manager.sh`
2. Template configurations for issues and PRs
3. Initial GitHub Actions workflows
4. Basic security scanning
5. Documentation structure

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. High-Impact, Low-Effort Tasks
- [ ] Add feature request template with impact assessment
- [ ] Implement automated PR size checking
- [ ] Add stale issue management
- [ ] Set up basic branch protection rules
- [ ] Configure automated dependency updates

### 2. Critical Security Features
- [ ] Implement secret scanning workflow
- [ ] Add SAST/DAST security checks
- [ ] Configure dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Set up security policy and response templates
- [ ] Implement automated security patches

### 3. Developer Experience Improvements
- [ ] Add commit message templates
- [ ] Configure automated code formatting
- [ ] Set up PR templates with checklists
- [ ] Implement automated PR labeling
- [ ] Add documentation generation

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** (Week 1)
   ```bash
   # Core templates
   - Bug report template
   - Feature request template
   - Basic PR template
   
   # Essential workflows
   - CI pipeline
   - Security scanning
   - Automated tests
   ```

2. **Phase 2: Security** (Week 2)
   ```bash
   # Security features
   - Secret scanning
   - Dependency checks
   - Security policies
   
   # Protection rules
   - Branch protection
   - Review requirements
   - Status checks
   ```

3. **Phase 3: Automation** (Week 3)
   ```bash
   # Automation features
   - PR labeling
   - Issue management
   - Release automation
   
   # Quality checks
   - Code formatting
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation
   ```

## Critical Configurations

### Required GitHub Secrets
```yaml
secrets:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: Required for API access
  CODECOV_TOKEN: For coverage reporting
  SONAR_TOKEN: For code quality
  NPM_TOKEN: For package publishing
```

### Essential Files
```
.github/
  workflows/
    ci.yml
    security.yml
    release.yml
  ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
    bug_report.md
    feature_request.md
  PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  CODEOWNERS
  dependabot.yml
```

## Integration Points

### 1. GitHub API Integration
```bash
# Required endpoints
- Repository management
- Branch protection
- Status checks
- Release management
```

### 2. External Services
```yaml
services:
  required:
    - CodeCov
    - SonarQube
    - Snyk
  optional:
    - Dependabot
    - CodeClimate
    - CircleCI
```

## Known Gaps and Challenges

1. **Technical Debt**
   - Need to implement proper error handling in repo_manager.sh
   - Workflow templates need parameterization
   - Security scanning needs customization options

2. **Missing Features**
   - Advanced PR automation
   - Custom workflow generator
   - Team-specific templates
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Integration Issues**
   - GitHub API rate limiting
   - Token management
   - Service authentication

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term (1-2 months)
- [ ] AI-powered PR reviews
- [ ] Automated changelog generation
- [ ] Custom workflow builder
- [ ] Advanced security rules

### Medium Term (3-6 months)
- [ ] Team workload balancing
- [ ] Automated documentation updates
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Custom metric tracking

### Long Term (6+ months)
- [ ] ML-based code quality checks
- [ ] Automated refactoring suggestions
- [ ] Team collaboration analytics
- [ ] Project health scoring

## Decision Log

### Recent Decisions
1. Implemented repository management in shell for consistency
2. Chose GitHub Actions over Jenkins for CI/CD
3. Prioritized security features over advanced automation
4. Selected mdBook for documentation

### Pending Decisions
1. Choice of code quality tools
2. Automation granularity level
3. Custom workflow complexity
4. Integration service selection

## Quick Reference

### Common Operations
```bash
# Apply all configurations
Repository Management > Apply All Configurations

# Update workflows
Repository Management > Manage Workflows > Update All

# Check security status
Repository Management > Security Configuration > Status
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Common issues
1. Workflow failures: Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Template issues: Validate in .github directory
3. Protection rules: Verify in repository settings

# Quick fixes
- Reset configurations: Repository Management > Reset
- Update templates: Repository Management > Update Templates
- Fix permissions: Repository Management > Fix Permissions
```
