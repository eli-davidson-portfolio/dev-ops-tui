# Introducing Dev-Ops TUI Library

A new way to create beautiful terminal user interfaces in pure Bash.

<!-- more -->

We're excited to announce the initial release of Dev-Ops TUI Library, a powerful toolkit for creating professional terminal user interfaces in pure Bash.

## Why Another TUI Library?

While there are several TUI libraries available, we found that most of them either:

1. Required complex dependencies
2. Lacked DevOps-specific features
3. Were difficult to integrate into existing scripts

Dev-Ops TUI Library solves these problems by:

- Using pure Bash with minimal dependencies
- Focusing on DevOps use cases
- Providing simple, intuitive APIs

## Key Features

Let's look at some key features that make Dev-Ops TUI special:

=== "Dialog Components"
    - Message boxes
    - Input forms
    - Progress indicators
    - File browsers

=== "DevOps Integration"
    - Service management
    - Log viewers
    - Configuration editors
    - Deployment tools

=== "Customization"
    - Theming support
    - Custom components
    - Event handling
    - Layout management

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of creating a service management dialog:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
source "tui/components/dialog.sh"

# Create service list
services=("nginx" "postgresql" "redis")
statuses=()

# Get service statuses
for service in "${services[@]}"; do
    if systemctl is-active "$service" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        statuses+=("‚úÖ")
    else
        statuses+=("‚ùå")
    fi
done

# Create checklist dialog
selected=$(create_checklist "Service Manager" \
    "Select services to manage:" \
    "${services[@]}" \
    "${statuses[@]}")

# Handle selection
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    for service in $selected; do
        if create_yesno "Confirm" "Restart $service?"; then
            systemctl restart "$service"
        fi
    done
fi
```

## What's Next?

- [ ] Enhanced theme engine
- [ ] More DevOps integrations
- [ ] Custom component builder
- [ ] Plugin system
- [ ] Performance optimizations
